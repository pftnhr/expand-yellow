# A hodgepodge of code snippets that expand Yellow for me.

I have now created the contents as gists and merely link them here. The files here, with the exception of this README.md, will no longer be updated.

* [archive.html](https://gist.github.com/pftnhr/61fcd1a7881bb29d2a6f2272b0b4027d) – creates an archive that groups blog posts by year and month. The inspiration for this comes from the archive of the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
* [Tags](https://gist.github.com/pftnhr/ed6e8db5efa03961f91545b044a6a3a6) – creates a page that shows tags with a superscript count. The Code comes from [zenblom](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/discussions/739). The inspiration for this comes from the archive of the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
* [todo page](https://gist.github.com/pftnhr/6210e410339d2513c8d2cf1fbebe7d7a) – was created by me to have my todo list on the website. Now I use it as a kind of dashboard that shows my drafts and unlisted posts.
* [Special1stPost](https://gist.github.com/pftnhr/42bf385adb6a907c4c6315a4bd7de742) – lets you create a sticky post in a different design that is only on the blog homepage, and there at the top.
