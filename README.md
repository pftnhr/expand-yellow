# A hodgepodge of code snippets that expand Yellow for me.

## toc

* [archive.html](archive.html) – creates an archive that groups blog posts by year and month. The inspiration for this comes from the archive of the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
* [todo page](todo%20page) – was created by me to have my todo list on the website. Now I use it as a kind of dashboard that shows my drafts and unlisted posts.
* [Special1stPost](special1stpost) – lets you create a sticky post in a different design that is only on the blog homepage, and there at the top.
